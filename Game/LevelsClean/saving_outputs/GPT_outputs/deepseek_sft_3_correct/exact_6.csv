Incorrect

Correct

The goal is to show that x + 1 = 4, given the hypothesis that x = 3. The provided solution attempts to use the hypothesis to directly prove the goal, but it incorrectly applies the hypothesis to the goal instead of using it to simplify the goal. The correct approach is to substitute x = 3 into the goal, resulting in 3 + 1 = 4, which is true by arithmetic",  exact h,error,"You might need to open '/home/manooshree/PeanoFormalizer/NNG4' as a workspace in your editor
