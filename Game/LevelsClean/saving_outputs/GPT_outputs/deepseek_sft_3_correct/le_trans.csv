Explanation:
The natural language describes the transition from the assumption that z equals x plus the sum of a and b to the specific case where z equals y plus b. The goal is to show that y plus b equals x plus the sum of a and b. The provided proof step uses the 'rw' tactic to rewrite the assumption 'h' (z = x + (a + b)) in the assumption 'h2' (z =",  rw [hb],error,"You might need to open '/home/manooshree/PeanoFormalizer/NNG4' as a workspace in your editor

## Proof Step

We are given that \( y + b = x + (a + b) \). Our goal is to show that \( y + b = x + a + b \). By applying the commutative property of addition, we can rewrite \( x + (a + b) \) as \( x + a + b \).
