## Proof Step

We are given that \( 0 \times a = 0 \times b \). Our goal is to show that \( a = b \). We start by simplifying the given equation using the property that any number multiplied by zero is zero. This leaves us with \( 0 = 0 \times b \).",  repeat rw [mul_zero],error,"You might need to open '/home/manooshree/PeanoFormalizer/NNG4' as a workspace in your editor

  -- Now we proceed with the inductive case

mul_assoc,  -- a * b * d + a * b = a * (b * d + b),"rw [← mul_add] at hb2 was incorrect, should have been:
     rw [mul_add] at hb2
     -- a * (b * d) + a * b = a * (b * d + b)
     -- a * (b * d + b) = a * (b * d + b)
     -- This completes the proof

",No
mul_assoc,  -- a * b * d + a * b = a * (b * d) + a * b,"rw [mul_add] at hb2

Explanation:
The natural language description states that we can rewrite the left-hand side of the equation (a * b * d + a * b) into the form a * (b * d) + a * b. This is based on the definition of multiplication in the set of natural numbers, where multiplication is associative. The Lean 4 code uses the `rw [mul_add]` tactic to apply the associative property",  rw [mul_add],error,"You might need to open '/home/manooshree/PeanoFormalizer/NNG4' as a workspace in your editor
",Yes
mul_assoc,  -- a * b * d + a * b = a * b * d + a * b,"rw [mul_add] at hb2 by assumption/ [mul_add] at hb2

-- Rewrite the assumption using the fact that multiplication distributes over addition, changing a * b * d + a * b to a * b * d + a * b * 1.",  rw [← hd],error,"You might need to open '/home/manooshree/PeanoFormalizer/NNG4' as a workspace in your editor
