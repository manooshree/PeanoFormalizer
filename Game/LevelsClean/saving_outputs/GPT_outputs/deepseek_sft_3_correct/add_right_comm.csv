The new line of code is:
FL:  rw [add_assoc] at hb2

This line of code rewrites the LHS of the equation in the hypothesis `hb2` using the theorem `add_assoc`, changing a + b + c to a + (b + c), resulting in the",  rw [add_assoc],error,"You might need to open '/home/manooshree/PeanoFormalizer/NNG4' as a workspace in your editor

## Proof Step

We are given that for any three natural numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), the addition operation is associative. This means that \((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\). We are also given that \(a + (b + c) = a + (c + b)\). Our goal is to show that \(b + c = c",  rw [add_assoc],error,"You might need to open '/home/manooshree/PeanoFormalizer/NNG4' as a workspace in your editor

## Proof Step

  1. Apply the commutative property of addition to the left side of the equation: a + (b + c) = a + (c + b).
