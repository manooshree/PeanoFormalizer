## Proof Step

We are given that the successor of the sum of 0 and a natural number \( d \) is equal to the successor of \( d \). Our goal is to show that this implies that the sum of 0 and \( d \) is equal to \( d \). Using properties of successors, we can rewrite the left-hand side of the equation as the successor of the sum of",  rw [add_succ],error,"You might need to open '/home/manooshree/PeanoFormalizer/NNG4' as a workspace in your editor
