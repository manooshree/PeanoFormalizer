-- Reply to the question with the single line of Lean 4 code



### Generate the single line of Lean 4 code for this step:

The goal is to prove that for any natural number \( x \), if \( x = 37 \) then \( x = 37 \). The given hypothesis is \( hx \) which states that \( x =",  exact h,error,"You might need to open '/home/manooshree/PeanoFormalizer/NNG4' as a workspace in your editor
",Yes
