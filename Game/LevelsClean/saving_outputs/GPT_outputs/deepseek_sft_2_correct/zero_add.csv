zero_add,"-- Since both sides are equal, we are done with the base case","exact hx in hx2 ⟩

The single line of Lean 4 code for this step is:

-- Since both sides are equal, we are done with the base case

zero_add,-- Now using properties of successors we can rewrite 0 + succ d to succ (0 + d) on the LHS getting succ (0 + d) = succ d,"1 * succ d = succ (0 + d) → succ (0 + d) = succ d

-- Apply the inductive hypothesis to rewrite 0 + d to d on the LHS
-- Now we have succ d = succ d
