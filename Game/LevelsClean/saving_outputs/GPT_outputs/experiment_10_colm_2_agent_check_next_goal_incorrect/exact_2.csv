exact_2,exact_2_dev_1,-- We simplify the hypothesis of 0 + x = 0 + y + 2 to x = 0 + x + 2.,"I apologize for the confusion earlier. After reviewing the original natural language statement again, I realize that there was indeed a mistake in the natural language statement. However, I understand the intended meaning. It should be '-- We simplify the hypothesis of 0 + x = 0 + y + 2 to x = y + 2.'. Based on that understanding, the formalization in lean should be:

rw [zero_add, zero_add] at h",rw [zero_add] at h,"y x : ℕ
h : x = 0 + y + 2
⊢ x = y + 2
","y x : ℕ
h : 0 + x = 0 + y + 2
⊢ x = y + 2
",No,No,Yes
