World Name,Theorem Name,Natural Language,Predicted Formalization,True Tactic,Is Correct
addition_world_val,zero_add,-- Induct on n,induction n with d hd,induction n with d hd,Yes
addition_world_val,zero_add,-- substitute 0 -> 0 + 0 into the RHS giving us 0 + 0 = 0 + 0,rw [add_zero],nth_rewrite 3 [← add_zero 0],No
addition_world_val,zero_add,"-- 0 + 0 = 0 + 0, completing base case",rfl,rfl,Yes
addition_world_val,zero_add,-- 0 + succ d -> succ (0 + d) on LHS giving us succ (0 + d) = succ d,rw [add_succ],rw [add_succ],Yes
addition_world_val,zero_add,-- 0 + d -> d on LHS -> succ d = succ d,rw [hd],rw [hd],Yes
addition_world_val,zero_add,"-- succ d = succ d, QED",rfl,rfl,Yes
addition_world_val,zero_add,-- Begin by initiating induction on n,induction n with d hd,induction n with d hd,Yes
addition_world_val,zero_add,-- Using the properties of addition by 0 we can rewrite 0 + 0 to 0 on the LHS,rw [add_zero],rw [add_zero],Yes
addition_world_val,zero_add,"-- Since both sides are equal, we are done with the base case",rfl,rfl,Yes
addition_world_val,zero_add,-- Now using properties of successors we can rewrite 0 + succ d to succ (0 + d) on the LHS getting succ (0 + d) = succ d,rw [add_succ],rw [add_succ],Yes
addition_world_val,zero_add,-- Using the induction hypothesis we can rewrite succ (0 + d) to succ d,rw [hd],rw [hd],Yes
addition_world_val,zero_add,"-- Since both sides are equal, we are done with the proof",rfl,rfl,Yes
