multiplication_world_val,zero_mul,-- Proof by induction on m with base case 0 * 0 = 0 and inductive step 0 * d + 1 = 0,induction m with d hd,induction m with d hd,Yes
multiplication_world_val,zero_mul,-- First prove base case. Simplify LHS 0 * 0 to 0,rw [mul_zero],rw [mul_zero],Yes
multiplication_world_val,zero_mul,-- The base case is not complete.,rfl,rfl,Yes
multiplication_world_val,zero_mul,"-- Now for the inductive step. Rewrite LHS 0 * succ (d) to 0 * d + 0, using the definition of multiplication",rw [mul_succ],rw [mul_succ],Yes
multiplication_world_val,zero_mul,-- Simplify the LHS 0 * d + 0 to 0 + 0 using the definition of addition,rw [hd],rw [add_zero],Yes
multiplication_world_val,zero_mul,-- This is exactly the inductive hypothesis so we can complete the proof.,rw [add_zero],exact hd,No
multiplication_world_val,zero_mul,-- Proof by induction on m with base case 0 * 0 = 0 and inductive step 0 * d + 1 = 0,induction m with d hd,induction m with d hd,Yes
multiplication_world_val,zero_mul,-- 0 * 0 = 0 -> 0 = 0,rw [mul_zero],rw [mul_zero],Yes
multiplication_world_val,zero_mul,-- That proves the base case.,rfl,rfl,Yes
multiplication_world_val,zero_mul,-- 0 * succ d = 0 -> 0 * d + 0 = 0 -> 0 * d = 0,"rw [mul_succ, add_zero, hd]","rw [mul_succ, add_zero]",No
multiplication_world_val,zero_mul,-- This is exactly the inductive hypothesis so we can complete the proof.,rfl,exact hd,Yes
