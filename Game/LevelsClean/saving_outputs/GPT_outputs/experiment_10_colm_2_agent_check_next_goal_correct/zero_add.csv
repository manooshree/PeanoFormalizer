As such, there's no valid correction I can provide. An instruction to substitute 0 with 0 + 0 in the RHS doesn't apply or make logical sense in the given lean state.

zero_add,"-- Since both sides are equal, we are done with the base case","I'm sorry, but there seems to be a miscommunication. The task seems to have an inconsistency between the provided Lean proof state and the natural language explanation. Specifically, the Lean state is in the middle of an inductive step, not the completion of a base case. The provided natural language statement corresponds to the `rfl` command in Lean, which is used to finalize a proof step when both sides of a goal are identical. However, in the provided Lean state, both sides of the goal are not identical. More context or corrections to the task may be needed to resolve this discrepancy.",rfl,"case succ
