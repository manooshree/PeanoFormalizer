-- Proof Statement: Prove that if a is less than or equal to b, then a times t is less than or equal to b times t.
theorem mul_le_mul_right (a b t : ℕ) (h : a ≤ b) : a * t ≤ b * t := by
  -- The inequality a ≤ b expresses the fact that b is equal to a plus some natural number d.
  cases h with d hd
  -- We use d * t as a specific natural number that can be used to change a * t ≤ b * t into b * t = a * t + d * t.
  use d * t
  -- We know that b = a + d, so we can substitute b with a + d in the goal. Then rewrite the goal to a * t + d * t = a * t + d * t by the distributive property of multiplication over addition.
  rw [hd, add_mul]
  -- Our goal is a * t + d * t = a * t + d * t, so we can use reflexivity to prove the goal.
