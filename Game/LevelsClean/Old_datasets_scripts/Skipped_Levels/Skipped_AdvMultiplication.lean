-- Proof Statement: Prove that if a is less than or equal to b, then a times t is less than or equal to b times t.
theorem skipped_mul_le_mul_right (a b t : ℕ) (h : a ≤ b) : a * t ≤ b * t := by
  -- We consider the case where the inequality a ≤ b can be expressed as b being equal to a plus some natural number d.
