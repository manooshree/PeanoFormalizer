skipped_exact_2_temp,rw [zero_add] at h,True,33.65636730194092,"You have not used the hypothesis 'h' in the proof. You also seem to have a typo in the hypothesis, it should be '0 + x = y + 2' instead of 'x = 0 + y + 2'.",Can you spot the typo in your hypothesis?,The next step is to correct the hypothesis to '0 + x = y + 2' and use it in the proof.
skipped_mul_one_temp,rw [mul_succ],True,32.423866510391235,"You tried to simplify m * 1 by rewriting 1 as succ 0, but it doesn't help to simplify the equation.",Can you think of a property of multiplication that could simplify m * succ 0?,The next step is to use the property of multiplication that m * succ 0 is equivalent to m.
skipped_eq_succ_of_ne_zero_temp,['tauto'],True,10.109403610229492,"You seem to have made a mistake in your proof. The goal is to find a natural number n such that succ d = succ n, but your proof does not establish this.",Can you think of a natural number that would satisfy the equation succ d = succ n?,"The next step is to recognize that d itself is the natural number you're looking for, because succ d is equal to succ n when n is d."
skipped_add_left_comm_temp,rw [add_comm],True,46.665993452072144,"You've correctly started by associating the left side of the equation, but then you swapped a and b, which was not necessary and led to an incorrect equation.",Can you think of a way to transform b + a + c into b + (a + c) without swapping any terms?,"The next step is to realize that b + a + c is already in the form b + (a + c), so no further transformation is required."
skipped_le_zero_temp,Not able to be generated,False,2582.649774312973,"You're trying to apply symmetry to the equation x + y = 0, but this doesn't help to simplify the problem.",Not able to be generated,Not able to be generated
skipped_pow_two_temp,Not able to be generated,False,229.04994988441467,"You're trying to rewrite the exponent 2 as 'succ 1', but this doesn't simplify the equation in a useful way.",Not able to be generated,Not able to be generated
skipped_add_zero_intro_temp,rw [add_zero],True,24.101195812225342,"You've only simplified one part of the equation. The left-hand side of your equation, a + b + (c + 0), still has a zero that needs to be addressed.",Can you see another zero in the equation that needs to be simplified?,The next step is to rewrite a + b + (c + 0) as a + b + c.
skipped_add_left_cancel_temp,['apply add_right_cancel'],True,9.221868991851807,"You've swapped the places of 'n' and 'a' and 'n' and 'b' in your equations, but this doesn't help you prove that 'a' equals 'b'.",Can you think of a property that would allow you to cancel 'n' from both sides of the equation?,"The next step is to apply the property that if 'a + n' equals 'b + n', then 'a' must equal 'b'."
skipped_add_assoc_2_temp,rw [add_zero],True,259.4712665081024,"You are trying to prove the associativity of addition, but you are not simplifying the right-hand side of the equation correctly.",What happens when you add zero to a number?,"The next step is to rewrite a + (b + 0) as a + b, because adding zero to a number doesn't change its value."
