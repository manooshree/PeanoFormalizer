truncated_exact_6_temp,['exact (h)'],True,5.881504774093628,Your rewrite command using 'four_eq_succ_three' is incorrect because this doesn't simplify or expand the equation in a useful way.,Have you considered using the given hypothesis to directly prove the goal?,The next step is to use the given hypothesis 'h' to directly prove that x = 3.
truncated_two_mul_temp,rfl,True,13.157383441925049,"You've already completed the proof that 2 * m = m + m. The last step you took, trying to rewrite m + m using one_mul, is unnecessary and incorrect.",Can you see that the equation 2 * m = m + m is already in its simplest form and doesn't need any further simplification?,The next step is to understand that the proof is already complete and no further steps are required.
truncated_mul_right_eq_one1_temp,Not able to be generated,False,2310.1784279346466,"You've stated that x * y ≠ 0 and that x * y = 1, but you haven't used these facts to simplify or expand your proof.",Not able to be generated,Not able to be generated
truncated_succ_ne_zero_temp,['trivial'],True,9.527509689331055,You are incorrectly trying to use the 'is_zero_zero' theorem which states zero is zero. But your goal is to prove that the successor of a natural number is not zero.,Can you think of a property that distinguishes zero from the successor of any natural number?,The next step is to realize that the successor of any natural number is never zero. This is a basic property of natural numbers.
truncated_le_one_temp,apply succ_le_succ at hx,True,511.95069551467896,"You are trying to rewrite succ y to be 0 or 1, which is not possible because succ y is always greater than 0.",Can you think of a way to use the given inequality to simplify the problem?,"The next step is to apply the inequality succ y ≤ succ 0, which simplifies to y ≤ 0."
truncated_pow_pow2_temp,Not able to be generated,False,826.1028971672058,You have not used your inductive hypothesis in your induction step.,Not able to be generated,Not able to be generated
truncated_add_right_eq_zero_temp,exact h,True,516.5154502391815,"You've correctly identified that if a + b = 0, then a must be 0. However, you've made a mistake in your execution. You're trying to rewrite a + b = 0 using the rule a + 0 = a, but b is not necessarily 0.",Can you think of a property of natural numbers that might help you prove the statement directly without needing to rewrite the equation?,"The next step is to recognize that in the natural numbers, if a + b = 0, then both a and b must be 0. So, you can directly use the hypothesis h to prove that a = 0."
truncated_add_right_comm_2_temp,rw [add_assoc],True,18.91875123977661,You have wrongly applied the commutative property of addition on 'b' and 'c' in the middle of the addition chain.,Can you think of a way to move 'b' to the end of the addition chain without changing the order of 'a' and 'c'?,The next step is to rewrite 'a + (c + b)' as '(a + c) + b'.
