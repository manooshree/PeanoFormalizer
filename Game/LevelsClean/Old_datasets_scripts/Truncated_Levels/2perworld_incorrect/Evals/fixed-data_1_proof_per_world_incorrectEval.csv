exact_9_dev_1_temp,['rw [succ_eq_add_one]'],True,12.505055904388428,"You're trying to apply 'succ_inj' to 'x + 1 = y + 1', but 'succ_inj' needs 'succ x = succ y'.",Can you rewrite 'x + 1' and 'y + 1' in a form that can be used with 'succ_inj'?,The next step is to rewrite 'x + 1' and 'y + 1' as 'succ x' and 'succ y' respectively.
mul_add_train1_temp,['rw [mul_succ]'],True,10.681257724761963,"You are trying to rewrite using the induction hypothesis, but the current goal doesn't match the hypothesis.",Can you recall a theorem that relates multiplication with the successor of a number?,"The next step is to rewrite a * (succ b + c) as a * succ b + a * c, using the properties of multiplication with the successor of a number."
eq_succ_of_ne_zero_train1_temp,['tauto'],True,9.343971014022827,You seem to have misunderstood the induction principle. The 'rfl' error is indicating that the equation 'succ n✝ = succ n' does not hold true for all natural numbers 'n'.,Can you think of a way to generalize the inductive step to all natural numbers?,The next step is to ensure that the equation 'succ n✝ = succ n' holds true for all natural numbers 'n'.
var_swap_dev_1_temp,['rw [add_comm b d]'],True,13.480310440063477,"You've made a mistake in your commutation operation. You swapped b and d, but you should have swapped c and d.","Can you think of a way to rearrange the terms such that d and b are swapped, keeping the rest of the equation intact?",The next step is to rewrite a + (c + (b + d)) as a + (c + (d + b)).
le_zero1_temp,rw [hy],True,250.29890060424805,"You are trying to apply add_left_eq_zero, which is not applicable in this context.",What does the equation x + y = 0 tell you about the values of x and y in the natural numbers?,"The next step is to rewrite x as 0, since any natural number added to 0 yields 0."
pow_add_persona3_temp,['rfl'],True,10.386385679244995,"You're trying to rewrite a term that doesn't exist in your current goal. The goal is 'a ^ m = a ^ m', but you're trying to rewrite '?m ^ succ ?n'.",Can you identify the terms in your current goal and compare them with the ones you're trying to rewrite?,"You should notice that the goal is already true, 'a ^ m = a ^ m', so there's no need to rewrite anything. The next step is to simply acknowledge this fact."
add_zero_2_persona_2_d_temp,['rw [add_zero]'],True,14.893978834152222,"You have only applied the add_zero theorem once, but it needs to be applied twice in this case.",Can you think of a way to apply the theorem to each instance of adding zero in your equation?,The next step is to apply the add_zero theorem to both 'b + 0' and 'c + 0'.
add_right_cancel_dev_1_temp,rw [add_succ] at h,True,757.3784534931183,"You are incorrectly simplifying a + n and b + n as a and b respectively by using add_zero, which is not applicable here.",Can you think of a way to simplify a + n and b + n when n is a successor of some number?,The next step is to rewrite a + succ d and b + succ d as succ (a + d) and succ (b + d) respectively.
add_right_comm_persona_2_d_temp,rw [add_comm],True,72.48250675201416,"You've correctly used the associativity property, but it doesn't help to swap b and c in the equation a + (b + c).",Can you think of a property that allows you to swap two terms in an addition?,"The next step is to apply the commutative property to b + c to get c + b, which will give you a + (c + b)."
