If the goal is to rewrite n + 0 to n on the right-hand side, then typically, the appropriate Lean code would be rw [add_zero]. However, the compilation error you're receiving seems to suggest that this isn't matching the current state of your proof. Without the exact state of your proof, it's challenging to provide the correct Lean code. You may want to double-check the current state of your proof and the exact transformation you wish to apply.",rw [add_zero],No
