In Lean, it could be expressed as follows: `theorem T (_dev_1 : ℕ) : (nat.succ 0 = 1 ∨ nat.succ 0 = 2) -> nat.succ 0 = _dev_1`. 

However, this doesn't make a lot of logical sense as it's saying that if the successor of zero (which is 1) equals either 1 or 2, then it equals _dev_1. Given that the left-hand condition can only ever validate to true if _dev_1 equals 1, this theorem can probably be better expressed in a different way or may actually not be intended at all, depending on what you're aiming to prove.
