truncated_exact_6_temp,rw [four_eq_succ_three] at h,True,29.442829608917236,"You're trying to rewrite the expression in the goal state, but you should be rewriting the hypothesis.",Can you think of a way to apply your rewrite to the hypothesis instead?,The next step is to rewrite the hypothesis 'x + 1 = 4' as 'x + 1 = succ 3'.
truncated_two_mul_temp,['rfl'],True,8.103739023208618,"You have correctly simplified the equation to m + m = m + m, but you haven't concluded the proof. The left-hand side and the right-hand side of the equation are already equal.",Do you see that the left-hand side and the right-hand side of your equation are already equal?,"The next step is to state that the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the equation are equal, thus concluding the proof."
truncated_mul_right_eq_one1_temp,Not able to be generated,False,937.8140740394592,"You have assumed that x * y ≠ 0, but you haven't used this assumption in your proof. Also, you tried to rewrite x * y as 1, which doesn't help to prove that x = 1.",Not able to be generated,Not able to be generated
truncated_succ_ne_zero_temp,['trivial'],True,7.7142298221588135,You are trying to use the zero property on a non-zero term. This is not valid.,Can you see why the zero property does not apply here?,The next step is to use the 'trivial' property instead of trying to rewrite using the zero property.
truncated_le_one_temp,right,True,99.09119606018066,"You have tried to rewrite the inequality succ y ≤ succ 0, but this doesn't help in proving the goal succ y = 0 ∨ succ y = succ 0.",What values can 'succ y' take given the inequality 'succ y ≤ succ 0'?,"The next step is to realize that 'succ y' can only be equal to 'succ 0', since it's greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1."

truncated_add_right_comm_2_temp,rw [add_assoc],True,31.94972324371338,"You have correctly used the associativity of addition to rewrite the left hand side of the equation, but the commutativity of addition isn't applicable in this case.",Can you think of another property of addition that might be helpful here?,"The next step is to use the associativity of addition again, to rewrite a + (c + b) as (a + c) + b."
