zero_add_coldstart,induction n with d hd,True,0,,Can you think of a way to break down the problem into a base case and an induction step?,"The next step is to perform induction on 'n'. This involves considering the base case where 'n' is zero, and the inductive step where 'n' is the successor of some number 'd'."
add_right_comm_coldstart,rw [add_assoc],True,0,,"Can you think of a way to rearrange the addition operation to group a and b together, then a and c together?","The next step is to rewrite a + b + c as (a + b) + c, then as (a + c) + b."
add_left_cancel_coldstart,repeat rw [add_comm n],True,0,,Can you think of a way to rearrange the addition so that 'n' is not the first term on both sides of the equation?,The next step is to rewrite the equation so that 'a + n' equals 'b + n' instead of 'n + a' equals 'n + b'.
add_right_eq_zero_coldstart,cases b with d,True,0,,What happens if we consider the case where 'b' is zero and the case where 'b' is the successor of some natural number 'd' separately?,"The next step is to consider two scenarios: one where 'b' is zero, and another where 'b' is the successor of some natural number 'd'."
one_le_of_ne_zero,apply eq_succ_of_ne_zero at ha,True,0,,Can you think of a way to express a non-zero natural number as the successor of another natural number?,The next step is to express your non-zero natural number 'a' as the successor of some other natural number.
mul_right_eq_one,have h2 : x * y ≠ 0,True,0,,Have you considered what happens when you multiply any natural number by zero? Can this product equal to 1?,"The next step is to assert that the product of x and y cannot be zero, because we know that the product of any number and zero is zero, not one."
succ_peano_dev_1,rw [← pred_succ a],True,0,,Can you think of a way to rewrite 'a' using the predecessor of its successor?,"The next step is to rewrite 'a' as the predecessor of its successor, i.e., 'a' becomes 'pred (succ a)'."
succ_ne_succ,contrapose! h,True,0,,"Can you think of a way to rephrase the inequality so that it's not about 'm ≠ n', but about 'succ m ≠ succ n'?",The next step is to use contraposition on the inequality 'm ≠ n'. This will flip the inequality around so that it's about 'succ m ≠ succ n' instead.
zero_le,use x,True,0,,What number can you use to show that zero is less than or equal to any natural number?,"The next step is to use the number itself, 'x', to show that 0 is less than or equal to 'x'."
le_antisymm1,cases hxy with a ha,True,0,,Have you considered what the ≤ relation implies about x and y? Can you express x in terms of y?,The next step is to express x as y plus some natural number a. This follows from the definition of the ≤ relation.
exact_6,apply succ_inj,True,0,,Can you think of a way to isolate 'x' from the equation 'x + 1 = 4'?,"The next step is to apply the principle that if 'a + 1 = b' then 'a = b - 1'. In this case, if 'x + 1 = 4' then 'x = 4 - 1' which gives 'x = 3'."
exact_10,apply h2 at h1,True,0,,What happens when you apply the assumption that x ≠ y to the equation x = y?,"The next step is to apply the assumption that x ≠ y to the equation x = y. This will lead to a contradiction, proving the statement false."
succ_mul,induction b with d hd,True,0,,How would you proceed if you were to use the principle of mathematical induction on 'b'?,"The next step is to apply induction on 'b'. This means we consider the base case where 'b' is zero, and then the inductive step where 'b' is some natural number 'd'."
two_mul,rw [two_eq_succ_one],True,0,,Can you think of a way to express the number 2 in terms of the successor of another number?,"The next step is to rewrite 2 as the successor of 1. In other words, we can express 2 as 1 + 1."
pow_add,induction n with d hd,True,0,,Have you considered using induction on 'n' to simplify the problem?,"The next step is to apply induction on 'n', which will give us a base case and an inductive case to work with."
pow_two,rw [two_eq_succ_one],True,0,,Can you think of a way to express 2 as a successor of a natural number?,"The next step is to rewrite 2 as the successor of 1, i.e., 2 = 1 + 1."
rw_intro,rw [h],True,0,,"Can you substitute 'y' in the equation with 'x + 7', which you have already defined as equivalent?",The next step is to replace 'y' in the equation with 'x + 7'.
succ_eq_add_one_coldstart,rw [← add_zero n],True,0,,Can you rewrite n in a way that it is equivalent but involves addition with zero?,The next step is to rewrite n as n + 0.
