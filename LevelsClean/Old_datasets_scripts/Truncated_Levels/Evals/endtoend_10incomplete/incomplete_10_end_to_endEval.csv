truncated_exact_6_temp,['rw [h]'],True,11.00621485710144,"You're trying to rewrite the equation using 'four_eq_succ_three', but it's not applicable here because the equation doesn't contain '4'.",Can you see a way to use the given hypothesis directly?,The next step is to rewrite 'x + 1' as '4' using the given hypothesis.
truncated_two_mul_temp,['rfl'],True,6.470560789108276,You've made a calculation error in your last step. Your equation m + m = m + m is already correct.,What does it mean when both sides of your equation are the same?,"The next step is to realize that since both sides of your equation are identical, your proof is complete."
truncated_mul_right_eq_one1_temp,Not able to be generated,False,2871.3533182144165,"You've assumed that x * y ≠ 0, which is a contradiction since you've also asserted that x * y = 1. These two statements cannot both be true.",Not able to be generated,Not able to be generated
truncated_succ_ne_zero_temp,['trivial'],True,7.693328142166138,You've made an error in your reasoning. The successor of a number can never be zero.,What can you say about the successor of any natural number?,The next step is to realize that the successor of any natural number is never zero.
truncated_le_one_temp,Not able to be generated,False,1761.7544901371002,"The rewrite rule you used, 'one_eq_succ_zero', does not help in solving 'succ y ≤ succ 0'. You are trying to simplify the expression in a way that doesn't lead to the goal.",Not able to be generated,Not able to be generated
truncated_pow_pow2_temp,Not able to be generated,False,2027.257266998291,"You have not used the inductive hypothesis in your proof. Remember, the inductive hypothesis is a crucial part of proving statements by induction.",Not able to be generated,Not able to be generated
truncated_add_right_eq_zero_temp,Not able to be generated,False,2435.5974881649017,"You are trying to simplify a + succ d = 0, but this equation cannot be simplified to a = 0 using the rule a + 0 = a.",Not able to be generated,Not able to be generated
